The purpose of this project was to create an android app for Wheaton College visitors which would make their touring experience
more informative and efficient. The app features a highly interactive map of Wheaton College's campus which allows for users to
search and filter by different types of buildings and locations (parking lots/fields) and find directions to them from their current
locationl. The app also allows for users to click on buildings and view important information pertaining to those buildings like
hosted departments, telephone numbers, an overview of the building's purpose, and etc.
